<!-- How website work with the  concept of client, server, request, response,  browser, backend , frontend , database,
basic structure of html  -->

<!-- 
Websites operate through the interaction of clients, servers, browsers, and databases.
The client (e.g., a browser) sends requests to a server, which processes them, often using a database, and sends back a response.
The frontend, built with HTML for structure, CSS for styling, and JavaScript for interactivity,
provides the visual and interactive elements users see.
The backend handles server logic, database management, and user requests. 
This coordinated workflow ensures seamless data exchange and user experience, making it essential for understanding web development basics.

<!-- Basic Workflow of a Website

1. User Action: A user enters a URL in the browser.
2. Request Sent: The browser sends a request to the server hosting the website.
3. Server Processing: The server processes the request, often interacting with a database.
4. Response Sent: The server sends the requested content (HTML, CSS, JavaScript) back to the browser.
5. Rendering: The browser renders the content for the user to view and interact with. -->
